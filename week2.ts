/*
  ALL TASKS MUST BE IMPLEMENTED WITH TYPESCRIPT!
  Use interfaces and data types in all cases to explicitly specify the types
  for variables, function parameters, function return values and object structures. 
*/

/*
Task 1 - Greeter function
Create a function with the name GreeterFunction that takes a string as a parameter and returns a string that says "Hello, " + the parameter.
*/
/* Write your solution here */

/* 
Task 2 - Define a city object and use an interface to define the object structure.
The city object should have the following properties
- name
- population
- country

The city object should be assigned to cityObject variable.

The city object should describe Helsinki, Finland with population of 600000.
*/

let cityObject = null; // Assign your city object to cityObject variable.

/*
Task 3 - Create a class to describe an animal.
The animal class should have the following properties:
- name, such as "Cat", "Snake" etc.
- age in years

Then create two new animal objects, which should be assigned to animal1 and animal2 variables.
animal1 should have name "Cat" and age 2
animal2 should have name "Dog" and age 3
*/
class Animal {
  /* Write your solution here */
}

let animal1 = null; // initialize the animal1
let animal2 = null; // initialize the animal2

/* Task 4 - Improve your solution for Task 3 so that the Animal
  class has a method called "makeSound". This improved solution should be implemented 
  in a class named Animal2. 

  The method should return a string in the following format "I am a <name> and I sound like <sound>".
  Where <name> is the name of the animal and <sound> is the sound the animal makes.
  The sound should be defined when the animal object is created.

  Use your Animal2 class to create two animal objects. You should create:
  - snake, which makes a sound "hiss", age is 4
  - lion, which makes a sound "roar", age is 8

  The animal objects should be assigned to snake and lion variables respectively.
*/

let snake = null; // Initialize the snake
let lion = null; // Initialize the lion
